# Previously On

This is a React project integrated with the [BetaSeries API](https://developers.betaseries.com/), designed to provide a seamless experience for managing and discovering TV shows and movies. While the project can run without a Node.js server, incorporating Node.js significantly enhances performance. The difference is noticeableâ€”enabling Node.js offers faster response times, better handling of API requests, and overall smoother interactions. Once you see it in action, the performance boost will be clear.

## Key Features

- **React-based Frontend**: Provides a modern, responsive user interface for interacting with the BetaSeries API.
- **BetaSeries API Integration**: Fetch and manage data related to TV shows and movies.
- **Optional Node.js Backend**: While the project can run without a backend, adding a Node.js server improves API handling, caching, and reduces client-side workload.

## Why Use Node.js?

Running the project with Node.js adds an extra layer of optimization:

- **Improved API Request Handling**: Node.js helps streamline communication with the BetaSeries API, reducing the latency for data retrieval.
- **Better Performance**: Offloading some processes to a Node.js server takes the strain off the frontend, providing a faster, smoother experience.
- **Scalability**: Ideal if you plan to extend the project in the future, such as adding a database or additional features.
